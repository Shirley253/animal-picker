                <h2>The Australian Wombat</h2>
                <p>Wombats are short-legged, muscular quadrupedal marsupials that
                  are native to Australia. They are about 1 m (40 in) in length
                  with small, stubby tails. There are three extant species and
                  they are all members of the family Vombatidae. They are adaptable
                  and habitat tolerant, and are found in forested, mountainous,
                  and heathland areas of south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania,
                  as well as an isolated patch of about 300 ha (740 acres) in
                  Epping Forest National Park[2] in central Queensland.</p>

                <h2>The Grizzley Bear</h2>
                <p>The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos ssp.) is a large subspecies of
                  brown bear inhabiting North America. Scientists generally do
                  not use the name grizzly bear but call it the North American
                  brown bear. Multiple morphological forms sometimes recognized as
                  subspecies exist, including the mainland grizzly (Ursus arctos
                  horribilis),Kodiak bear (U. a. middendorffi), peninsular grizzly
                  (U. a. gyas), and the recently extinct California grizzly
                  (U. a. californicus†)[1][2] and Mexican grizzly bear (U. a. nelsoni†).
                   On average bears near the coast tend to be larger while inland
                   grizzlies tend to be smaller. The Ussuri brown bear (U. a. lasiotus)
                   inhabiting Russia, Northern China, and Korea[3][4][5] is
                   sometimes referred to as the black grizzly, although it is a
                   different subspecies from the bears in America.</p>

                <h2>The Moose</h2>
                <p>The moose (North America) or elk (Eurasia), Alces alces, is the
                  largest extant species in the deer family. Moose are distinguished
                  by the broad, flat (or palmate) antlers of the males; other members
                  of the family have antlers with a dendritic ("twig-like")
                  configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate
                  broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate
                  to subarctic climates. Hunting and other human activities have caused
                  a reduction in the size of the moose's range over time. Moose have been
                  reintroduced to some of their former habitats. Currently, most moose
                  are found in Canada, Alaska, New England, Fennoscandia, Baltic states,
                  and Russia. Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation.
                  The most common moose predators are the gray wolf along with bears and
                  humans. Unlike most other deer species, moose are solitary animals and
                  do not form herds. Although generally slow-moving and sedentary, moose
                  can become aggressive and move quickly if angered or startled. Their
                  mating season in the autumn features energetic fights between males
                  competing for a female.</p>
